## 🚀 **Implemented DSA**  
### ✅ **Data Structures**  
✔️ Arrays  
✔️ Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
✔️ Stacks  
✔️ Queues (Normal, Circular, Priority)  
✔️ Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL, Red-Black Tree)  
✔️ Graphs (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Prim’s)  
✔️ Hashing  

### ✅ **Algorithms**  
✔️ Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap)  
✔️ Searching (Linear, Binary, Jump)  
✔️ Recursion & Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver)  
✔️ Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LCS, LIS)  
✔️ Greedy Algorithms (Huffman Coding, Activity Selection)  
✔️ Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

## 🔥 **Why C# for DSA?**  
- Strong type safety and memory management  
- Fast execution and low overhead  
- Modern language features like LINQ, async/await, and pattern matching  
- Widely used in competitive programming and system design
