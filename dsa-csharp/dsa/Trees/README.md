# Trees in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## Introduction
A **Tree** is a hierarchical data structure used to represent relationships between elements. Unlike arrays, linked lists, stacks, or queues, which are linear, trees are **non-linear** and branch out in multiple directions.

### Why Use Trees?
- Efficiently store and retrieve hierarchical data (e.g., file systems, organizational charts).
- Optimize searching, insertion, and deletion operations in logarithmic time (O(log N) in balanced trees).
- Used in databases, compilers, networking, and AI (decision trees, syntax trees, etc.).

### When to Use Trees?
- When data has a hierarchical relationship (e.g., family trees, company structures).
- When you need **fast lookup, insert, and delete operations** (e.g., binary search trees, AVL trees).
- When implementing dynamic, sorted data structures (e.g., priority queues, heaps, B-trees in databases).
- When optimizing searching and retrieval (e.g., Trie for word searching, Segment Tree for range queries).

## History of Trees in Computer Science
- **1945:** First concepts of trees used in mathematical logic and computing.
- **1959:** AVL Tree introduced by Adelson-Velsky and Landis.
- **1960s:** Binary Search Trees (BST) became widely used.
- **1972:** B-Trees invented for databases.
- **1990s-Present:** Various self-balancing trees like Red-Black Trees, Splay Trees, and Segment Trees evolved for modern computing.

## Types of Trees & Their Use Cases
### 1. **Binary Tree**
- Each node has at most **two children** (left and right).
- Used in expression trees, Huffman coding, and file system indexing.

### 2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- A **sorted binary tree** where left child < parent < right child.
- Used in database indexing, auto-completion, and sorted data storage.
- **Example Problem:** Find the Kth smallest element in a BST.

### 3. **Balanced Trees (AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree)**
- Self-balancing BSTs that keep tree height O(log N).
- Used in databases (Red-Black Tree in Java’s TreeMap, AVL Tree in file systems).
- **Example Problem:** Self-balancing BST insertion and deletion.

### 4. **Heap (Binary Heap, Min-Heap, Max-Heap)**
- Special tree where parent nodes follow the heap property (Min-Heap: Parent ≤ Children, Max-Heap: Parent ≥ Children).
- Used in **priority queues, Dijkstra’s algorithm, scheduling systems**.
- **Example Problem:** Find the K largest elements in an array using a Min-Heap.

### 5. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**
- Efficiently stores **strings** where each node represents a character.
- Used in **autocomplete, dictionary searches, spell checking**.
- **Example Problem:** Find words with a given prefix in a dictionary.

### 6. **Segment Tree & Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree - BIT)**
- Used for **range queries and updates**.
- Segment Trees: Used in **range sum queries, RMQ (Range Minimum Query)**.
- **Example Problem:** Find the sum of a subarray efficiently.

### 7. **N-ary Tree**
- A generalization where each node can have **more than two children**.
- Used in XML/HTML parsing, AI decision trees.
- **Example Problem:** Find the depth of an N-ary tree.

## Basic Tree Implementation in C#

```csharp
using System;

class TreeNode {
    public int Value;
    public TreeNode Left;
    public TreeNode Right;

    public TreeNode(int value) {
        Value = value;
        Left = Right = null;
    }
}

class BinaryTree {
    public TreeNode Root;

    public BinaryTree(int rootValue) {
        Root = new TreeNode(rootValue);
    }

    public void InOrderTraversal(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return;
        InOrderTraversal(node.Left);
        Console.Write(node.Value + " ");
        InOrderTraversal(node.Right);
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        BinaryTree tree = new BinaryTree(10);
        tree.Root.Left = new TreeNode(5);
        tree.Root.Right = new TreeNode(15);
        tree.Root.Left.Left = new TreeNode(2);
        tree.Root.Left.Right = new TreeNode(7);

        Console.Write("InOrder Traversal: ");
        tree.InOrderTraversal(tree.Root);
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
InOrder Traversal: 2 5 7 10 15
```

## Common Tree Operations & Complexity
| Operation | Binary Search Tree (BST) | Balanced Trees (AVL/Red-Black) | Heap |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|------|
| Insert    | O(log N)         | O(log N)             | O(log N) |
| Delete    | O(log N)         | O(log N)             | O(log N) |
| Search    | O(log N)         | O(log N)             | O(N) |
| Traversal | O(N)             | O(N)                 | O(N) |

## Conclusion
Trees are fundamental in computer science and provide efficient solutions to many problems involving hierarchical relationships. Depending on the use case, different types of trees are used to optimize performance in real-world applications like databases, search engines, network routing, and more.

### **Next Steps**
